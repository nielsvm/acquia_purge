Future plans
================================================================================
 * Code cleanups and adherence to every relevant policy or standard required.
 * Upstream improvements and patches to expire.
 * D6 backport if the necessity for that gets high.
 * Become a plugin depending on Purge once Purge 2.X suits our needs and works.
 * Improving domain detection with improvements to Acquia's platform internals.
 * Show graphs on Varnish hit and miss rates.
