Roadmap (in non-prioritized order)
================================================================================
  * 2100327: add experimental HTTPS support.
  * 2035289: Bulk update of Nodes triggers a lot of Purges.
  * 2049235: AJAX processor is displayed when adding a video with Media.module.
  * 2019247: How do you Purge when entities are updated via Drush?
  * 2019247: More automatic purging from cron/drush?
  * 2014455: Widget hides preliminary when purging less than 10 urls.
  * 2014461: DSM message should be hidden by default and only show up once the JS is loaded.
  * Provide a INSTALL.txt and cleanup MULTISITE.txt to prevent misuse better.
  * Better built-in fire-prevention and self-diagnostics:
    * Drush 'ap-diagnosis'
    * Single-item status report representation.
    * At minimum the self-diagnostics should test for:
      * Are we on Acquia Cloud?
      * Purge or Varnish modules enabled? Boost module?
      * Is page_cache_maximum_age < 21600 (6 hours)
      * Disabled page cache / anonymous page caching.
      * What class handles Drupal page caching to detect issues with fake class.
      * Detect 5> domains and trigger INSTALL/MULTISITE reference.
      * Detect 4> load balancers.
  * Improving domain detection with improvements to Acquia's platform internals.
  * Integrate Varnish hit/miss statistics to better visualize the effectiveness.
  * D8 port and a D6 backport if demand is high enough for it.
  * Expire 2 impact analysis.
  * Become a plugin depending on Purge once Purge 2.X suits our needs and works.
