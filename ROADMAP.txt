Future plans
================================================================================
 * INSTALL.txt
 * progressbar: feedback visual take-over
 * progressbar:
 * dry run mode.
 * curl multi stuff?
 * ap-diagnosis
 * Diagnosis helper that does hook_requirement + ap-diagnosis, checks:
    * Are we on Acquia Cloud?
    * Purge or Varnish modules at play? Boost module?
    * Is page_cache_maximum_age < 21600 (6 hours)
    * Is page cache itself enabled at all?
    * What is implemented for the page cache backend?
    * More then 500*ACQUIA_PURGE_QUEUE_TRESHOLD items in queue? Raise flag.
    * More then 6 domains? Predict issues, trigger DOMAINS.TXT reference.
    * More then 10 balancers? Will get risky...
 * Code cleanups and adherence to every relevant policy or standard required.
 * Upstream improvements and patches to expire.
 * D6 backport if the necessity for that gets high.
 * Become a plugin depending on Purge once Purge 2.X suits our needs and works.
 * Improving domain detection with improvements to Acquia's platform internals.
 * Show graphs on Varnish hit and miss rates.
